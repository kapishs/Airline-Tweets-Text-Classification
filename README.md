# Airline Tweets Text Classification
This project focuses on classifying tweets related to airlines into three sentiment categories: positive, negative, and neutral. It utilises supervised learning techniques to build a model that can predict the sentiment of a tweet based on its text content.

# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to classify the sentiment of tweets related to various airlines. Given the importance of customer feedback in the aviation industry, this classification can help airlines better understand public sentiment and improve their services.

## The project involves the following key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Extraction
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Prediction on New Data
## Dataset
The dataset contains tweets directed at various airlines, along with the sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral) assigned to each tweet.

## Text
 The content of the tweet.
## Sentiment
 The label indicating the sentiment of the tweet, which can be positive, negative, or neutral.
## Example Data Structure:
Text	Sentiment
"Great flight experience!"	Positive
"Worst customer service ever."	Negative
"It was an okay flight."	Neutral

## Features and Labels
### Features:

The primary feature used for classification is the text content of the tweet.
Additional features such as tweet length, presence of certain keywords, and punctuation marks can be derived for further analysis.
### Labels

The target labels are:
1. Positive
2. Negative
3. Neutral
## Modeling Approach
The project follows a supervised learning approach to classify the tweets. The key steps include:

## Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning the text data by removing stop words, special characters, and URLs.
Converting text to lowercase and performing tokenization.
Optionally, performing stemming or lemmatization.

## Feature Extraction:

Converting text data into numerical features using techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
Model Training:

### Various classification algorithms are explored, including:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
3. Naive Bayes
4. Random Forest
Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimise model performance.

## Model Evaluation:

The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
## Prediction:

The final model is used to predict the sentiment of new tweets.


## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airline-tweets-classification.git
cd airline-tweets-classification
```
## Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run the project:
Execute the main script or Jupyter Notebook provided to start the classification process.

## Usage
1. Data Preprocessing: Run the preprocessing script to clean and  prepare the tweet data.
2. Model Training: Train the model using the provided training scripts.
3. Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the test dataset.
4. Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new tweets.
## Results
The final model's performance is summarised using the following metrics:

## Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
Precision, Recall, and F1-score: To assess the quality of the predictions across the three sentiment classes.
